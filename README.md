### Project Objectives
- Build a simulated server to listen request from the webstie and operate accordingly.
- The server has four primary HTTP methods (POST, GET, PUT, DELETE or **CRUD**).
- Utilize module export and import operation to practice Modular Design in Node.js runtime.

### Technologies
- Node.js
- Express.js
- relevant HTML, CSS, JavaScript

### Functionalities
- *Get* a random quote
- *Get* all quotes or quotes said by a person
- *Get* a quote via id
- *Post* or create a new quote with auto-generated id
- *Put* or update an existing quote through id
- *Delete* an existing quote through id

### Testing
- In order to fully function, run `npm install` to install Express before trying to start up your server.
- Use **Postman** to test out all the functions, dowload Postman --> [Postman](https://www.postman.com/).
- Or visit visit `localhost:4001` in the browser.

## Remarks
**The frontend or the website only works for operations without id related.**
